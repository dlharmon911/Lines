# Lines

## Use
An effect to draw a line. The starting point is the point at left mouse button press to the current mouse position. While the left mouse button is pressed, if the mouse axes move, a triangle is drawn.
The shade of the triangle rises to max then falls to zero. At the zero point the color changes.


## Key Commands
* 1 - single line
* 2 - same as 1, but mirrors the effect in opposite direction
* 3 - same as 2, but mirrors in both perpendicular directions
* space - clear
* tab - swap mouse positions
